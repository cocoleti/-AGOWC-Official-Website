		{AGOWC} was founded by real life Canadian Daniel Boda (AKA <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/cocoleti/">cocoleti</a>) for no reason<br>
		whatsoever except for wanting a tag infront of his name in CS:GO.<br>
		Now {AGOWC} has over 100 members and is actually not as useless as<br>
		it was originally intended to be. Daniel now makes websites including this one<br>
		and enjoys being a jackass on the internet for no apparent reason.<br>
		Oh ya and he wants to be a history teacher cause he's a nerd.
